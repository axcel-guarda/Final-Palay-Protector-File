Palay Protector

**Palay Protector** is an AI-powered rice disease detection and notification system designed to assist farmers in identifying rice plant diseases through image analysis. The system aims to promote early detection, timely intervention, and improved crop management using accessible web-based technology.

Project Overview

Rice farmers often struggle to identify plant diseases at an early stage, leading to reduced yield and increased losses. Palay Protector addresses this problem by allowing users to upload or capture images of rice leaves, which are then analyzed using an AI model trained on rice disease datasets. The system provides detection results, confidence levels, and disease information to support informed decision-making.
